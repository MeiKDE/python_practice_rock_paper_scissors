# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a simple game of rock, paper, scissors. The rules are simple:

- Rock beats scissors
- Scissors beats paper
- Paper beats rock  

The game is played against a computer, who choose either rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined by the following rules:

- If both players choose the same object, it's a tie.
- If one player chooses rock and the other chooses scissors, the rock wins.
- If one player chooses scissors and the other chooses paper, the scissors win.
- If one player chooses paper and the other chooses rock, the paper wins.


## How to play

To play the game, simply run the `rock_paper_scissors.py` file in your terminal. The computer will choose a random number between 0 and 2 (representing rock, paper, or scissors), and you will have to choose your number. The game will then determine the winner and print out the result.   

Here's an example of how to play:

```
What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, and 2 for Scissors.

You chose Scissors.

Computer chose Rock. You lose!

      (_____)
      (_____)
      (____)

In this example, the computer chose rock, and I chose scissors. The game determined that rock beats scissors, so I lost., and printed out the result.
